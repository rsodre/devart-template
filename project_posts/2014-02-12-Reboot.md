Cartograffiti prototype was developed during a period of 10 days in 2011.

A short time later, some smart upgrade on my hosting broke the Django server. Then my development machine burned, I lost my web development environment.

I took DEV ART as an opportunity to finally put it back online, upgrading all the underlying technologies, and hopefully finish it.

I had all my original installation notes, but it was quite old, so I started to setup my environment from scratch, upgrading everything I could, using my notes only as reference when I had some trouble.

It took me 2 days to reboot it, this is what I had to do...

- I created a new template application on my host with the latest versions, then installed the same on my local machine.

- Upgrade from [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/) 1.2 to 1.6.2. Easy one, just installed [pip](http://www.pip-installer.org/), then **pip install Django==1.6.2**.

- Install [psycopg](http://initd.org/psycopg/download/) 2.5.2, so Django can communicate with PostgreSQL. **pip install psycopg2**.

- Install [GDAL](http://www.gdal.org/), the Geospatial Data Abstraction Library. Downloaded a complete ser from [Kyngchaos](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/frameworks#gdal_complete).

- Install [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/) 9.3.1.1 server with [PostGIS](http://postgis.refractions.net/) 2.1.1. Also from [Kyngchaos](http://www.kyngchaos.com/software/postgres). Create a new GIS database, version 9.3 has some nice new feature to do that.

```
$ su - postgres
$ createdb <cgdb> -h localhost
$ createuser -w <cgdb> -h localhost
$ psql <cgdb> -l localhost
$ \c <cgdb>
$ CREATE EXTENSION postgis;
$ CREATE EXTENSION postgis_topology;
```

- My database keeps crashing, I tought it was not some comflict with Mountain Lion's built-in PostgreSQL client, but in the end, I really don't know. I just restart it when it happens as root.

```
launchctl unload /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postgresql.postgres.plist
launchctl load /Library/LaunchDaemons/org.postgresql.postgres.plist
```

- [This article](http://just-digital.net/posts/migrating-from-django-12-to-16/) saved me a lot of time just telling me I should create a new app and then moves all my models, views and templates to it.

```
django-admin.py startproject <cg>
cd <cg>
python manage.py startapp app
```

- Run the Django server and fix everything that's broken! Not much...

```
datetime.xxx()
	to
from dateutil import tz
datetime.xxx(tz.gettz(settings.TIME_ZONE))
```

```
HttpResponse(simplejson.dumps(data), mimetype="text/plain")
	to
HttpResponse(simplejson.dumps(data), content_type="text/plain")
```

```
import simplejson
simplejson.xxx()
	to
import json
json.xxx()
```

```
from models import xxx
	to
from app.models import xxx
```

- Trash deprecations...

```
DeprecationWarning: Using mimetype keyword argument is deprecated, use content_type instead
DeprecationWarning: django.utils.simplejson is deprecated; use json instead.
RuntimeWarning: DateTimeField Share.timestamp received a naive datetime (2014-02-09 18:00:25.914694) while time zone support is active.
```

- Upload everything to my host.

- Create a new PostgreSQL 9.3 database on the host, let's keep everything new.

- Database does not work! Something about GIS. Turned out GDAL on my host is 1.8, and now I need 1.10. Open a support ticket to migrato to another server, wait for 2 days...

- Woke up with a message from a guy doing a show and [Blendy VJ](http://www.blendy.in/vj/) crashing all the time! It means my host have moved and the new OS is breaking my products! Fix it!

- Go back and test the new server, not working! It turns out it uses **Python 3.3** and my local Mountain Lion **2.2**. And there's some incompatibility between them, nice! Back to development, [download a package](http://www.python.org/download/releases/3.3.4/), configure, make and make install.

- Install missing Python libraries not included on 3.3. **pip install python-dateutil**, **pip install Pillow**.

- Fix everything that Python 3.3 broke. Again, not much...

```
print "xxx"
	to
print ("xxx")
```

```
adict.has_key('key')
	to
'key' in adict
```

```
Image.open( path ).resize( (w,h), Image.ANTIALIAS )
	to
Image.open( path ).resize( (int(w),int(h)), Image.ANTIALIAS )
```
- Upload to host, it's alive!!! :)


## Next steps

My plan is to have weekly updates, acessing the following topics:

- Technology update (upgrade Processing.js and jQuery)
- Upload custom stencils/stickers
- GUI redesign
- Sharing Gallery
- Implement tile upload security
- Add custom layers (?)
- Heatmap (?)
